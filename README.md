Metropolis
=====

This application was the result of contemplation on Harry Beck's famous map and similar new mapping conventions which could emerge in society.
Distance from the center of map is determined by travel time instead of geographical coordinates.
Tram and metro lines are displayed.
Temporal information can be exchanged for geographical and viewing the tracks can be turned off.
See how this affects your feel of the city.

Tools used:

-Data including travel times and locations mined and normalized from Reittiopas API using Python (over 100k values fetched)
-App coded in Java using Processing.org libraries, all functionality in as little as 700 lines of code.
-Converted to Javascript on the fly for your browser using processing.js
